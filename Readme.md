The website is hosted at https://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~s3815020/wp/a2/ 
Notes:
1) Carousel images run smoothly and changes every few seconds and can be manually changed back and forth using arrow buttons or clicking the slide at the bottom of images. The images are free and sourced from unsplash.
2)The whole website can be viewed from an iPhone 12 pro. It is scaled well.
3)In the booking page, both client side and server side validation works. Submit without validation works well. Can also be tested by turning off Javascript of the browser.
4) Administration page works with login, creating admin, logout and viewing appointments in one single page depending on the status of user(logged or not).
5) Appointments.txt includes all information required but administration page only shows everything except the time the booking was made in as it seemed unnecessary. Human readable date is implemented including superscript.
6) Two users(Stephen and Abigale) at registered already, Kiyoko is not and left for testing by the marker.
7) Tools folder contains head, navbar and footer php files as it was common in all the main pages and used by "required_once" function of php.
